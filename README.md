The provided Python script is a simple voice-controlled virtual assistant named "Jarvis." Key features include dynamic greetings based on the time of day,
opening websites (YouTube, Google, Stack Overflow), playing music from a predefined YouTube playlist,
taking desktop screenshots, and signing off on user command.
The script uses libraries such as pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, speech_recognition for voice recognition,
and pyautogui for controlling music playback. 
Suggestions for improvement include enhancing command recognition, adding error handling, improving security, and modularizing the code.
